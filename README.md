Explanation
===========

I'm trying to develop (what seems to be) novel statistics for the analysis of
small samples, given a tolerated range of values and a tolerated success rate.
The planned application is flake-free regression testing of performance bugs.


Development
===========

Prerequisites
-------------
On a lark, I've used "credo" as my build system.
To build it for yourself, run bin/dev-bootstrap.


Have a look
-----------

```
yarn install
redo serve
```

Then browse to the URL it prints out.


Testing
-------

```
mocha
```
